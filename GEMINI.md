## Project Context for Wow! Taiwan Selects Web Page
This project involves creating an interactive web page to display the "Wow! Taiwan Selects 東南亞巡迴推廣活動深度分析" content.

**Key Features and Design Principles:**
- **Content Source**: The primary content is derived from `原文/WowTaiwanSelects.txt`.
- **Design Aesthetic**:
    - Background: White (`#fff`)
    - Titles: Accent color (`#b59f5b`)
    - Content Text: Dark Gray (`#222`)
    - Fonts: `Helvetica Neue`, Arial, `PingFang TC`, `Microsoft JhengHei`, sans-serif
- **Layout & Interactivity**:
    - **Responsive Web Design (RWD)**: Adapts to various screen sizes.
    - **Single-Column Layout**: A modern, single-column, magazine-style layout for immersive reading.
    - **Image Grids**: All project images are arranged in perfectly aligned, non-jagged grids, interspersed between text sections for a clean and professional look.
    - **Hover Effects**: Images gently scale up on hover, providing subtle user feedback.
    - **Scroll Animation**: Content sections fade in smoothly as the user scrolls, enhancing the premium feel of the page.
- **File Structure**:
    - `index.html`: The single file containing the structure, styling (via TailwindCSS), and all interactive scripts.
    - `image/`: Directory containing all 20 image assets.
    - `原文/WowTaiwanSelects.txt`: The original text content for the web page.

**Development History & Specific Instructions:**
- The project underwent several iterations. The initial multi-column and bento-grid approaches were discarded in favor of a cleaner, single-column narrative flow.
- Key user instructions that shaped the final design included:
    1.  Adhering to the design principles of the `見本.txt` file.
    2.  Using the full text from `原文/WowTaiwanSelects.txt`.
    3.  Ensuring all images are used and arranged in perfectly整齊 (neat) grids with no missing corners.
    4.  Adding subtle hover and scroll animations for a more dynamic experience.
    5.  Renaming image files to be more descriptive.
